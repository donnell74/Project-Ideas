Idea:
Create a mobile app that could later be added into MSU Mobile that replaces/aids the current voting system.

Detailed:
The voting app should be a lot like google surveys.
Would need a database to store questions, possible answers, and answers.
Should create notifications when new surveys are up so students are aware of open votes.
Should have an activity that shows all currently open votes.

Requirements:
database
android/ios
