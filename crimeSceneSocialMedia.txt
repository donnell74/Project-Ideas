Idea:
Create a web application that searches social media for photos, text, and people at a crime/medical scene.

Detailed Idea:
The web application would either take in input from a user or from a site like Austin, Tx open data portal.
It would take the address given (or lat/long) and use that to search twitter, facebook, and any other found useful.
Map objects found to better show the data, maybe add distance from scene.

APIs needed:
Twitter
Facebook
Google Maps
