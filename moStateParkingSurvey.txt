Idea:
Create a web page that surveys students about their parking for MoState's Student Experience Group.

Detailed:
Create database to store all the data
Ask students what lot they parked (or get gps data to guess)
Ask students where they park and if it was a legal parking space
Ask students when they first started looking for a spot
Ask students when their class is
Save current time to tell if they are late to class
Create flyers to hang up at each parking lot with a qr code for the web page
At end of each semester export database to csv and send to MoState's Student Experience Group
