Idea:
Research the idea of using a string of all past password for added security.

Details:
Keep a string that is a concatenated form of all past password not included newest one
concate new one and hash that for password
increase length of password which would increase security
may be to much processing on server side
may have to chop off first part to make it a certain size to avoid buffer overflow/locked server
because server does not have last part of key may help with security
I am not a security guy, this is just an idea
